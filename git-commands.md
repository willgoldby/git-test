# git tag
Adds tags to a branch. A tag describes a commit. For example, by specifying a version, like v1.0.2.

# git checkout -b branch-name
Creates a new branch and moves HEAD to that branch.

# git merge branch-name-you-want-to-merge
Adds the commits from the branch you name onto the branch you're in.

# git log --oneline
Prints out the commit history, line by line.
